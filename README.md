# Task 2: Phishing Simulation Using SEToolkit

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Task Objective:**

Simulate phishing attacks to test employee awareness and improve security training programs using Social Engineering Toolkit (SEToolkit).

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Skills Gained:**

- Social engineering techniques  
- Email and web phishing attack simulation  
- Security awareness training principles

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Tools Used:**

- SEToolkit (Social Engineering Toolkit)  
- Ngrok (for exposing local web servers)  
- Kali Linux or compatible Linux environment

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Task Description:**

In this task, we performed a **credential harvesting attack** by cloning a legitimate login page with SEToolkitâ€™s **Website Attack Vectors** module. The cloned page was hosted locally and made accessible via Ngrok to simulate a real phishing link. When a user interacts with the fake login page, credentials are captured and logged for analysis.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Deliverables:**

- Screenshots of SEToolkit interface, cloned login page, and captured credentials  
- Detailed report documenting the steps, results, and lessons learned (included in this repo)  
- Recommendations for improving user awareness and organizational security posture

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Outcome & Analysis:**

- Successfully cloned the target login page  
- Captured credentials as users submitted login data  
- Demonstrated the effectiveness of phishing attacks and the need for robust security awareness programs

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Recommendations:**

- Conduct regular phishing simulation exercises  
- Train employees to identify phishing attempts  
- Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) and email filtering

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Disclaimer:**

This task was performed in a controlled environment for educational purposes only. Unauthorized phishing activities are illegal and unethical.
